			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti."- Hannibal Lecter</p>
			<p>The only Horror film to win best picture, director, adapted screenplay, actress and actor (for <strong>Hopkins'</strong> 25 min turn, 2nd shortest performance for trophy) .It feels like <strong>Foster's</strong> movie more than anybody's : her vulnerable-but-steely Clarice Starling is defined by her ability, not her gender.</p><br>

			<p>Most competitive Best Picture races in memory. <em>Shawshank</em><i class="fa fa-imdb"></i> and <em>Pulp Fiction</em><i class="fa fa-imdb"></i> also were nominated that year. Role by childlike eyes of the simple but successful Forrest - the role which earned <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> his second Oscar in two years. It has mindblowing CGI too.</p><br>

			<p>45 years young and <strong>Spielberg's</strong> breakthrough remains the touchstone for event-movie cinema. That's half monster-on-the-rampage disaster, half guys-bonding-on-a-fishing-trip adventure. Therefore it's genuinely unsurpassable.</p><br>

			<p>It's a movie which can handle as many re-watches as you can throw at it. <strong>Ridley's</strong> deep-space monster-slasher makes you appreciate why he keeps coming back to that universe. When they shot the alien bursting-hurt's chest scene, the cast was not told what gonna happen, the horror on their faces were real.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it."- </p>
			<p>It is arguably <strong>Kubrick's</strong> greatest gift to cinema, an infinitely ambitious vision of a space-facing future whose narrative centres on the most pivotal moment in human evolutin since some ape-man first bashed another ape-man with an old bone. Graceful, gorgeous, unwearied by time's passing. It was first outer-space movie to take outer space-- and special effects- seriously (<strong>Kubrick</strong> destroyed most of the sets so that no one use it further). Remember HAL 9000?</p><br>

This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly kinded view of human nature. <strong>Freeman</strong>, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his carrer, both narrates this tale and anchors it with authoritative playing.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse "- Don Corleone</p>
			<p>It came as Mario Puzo's novel. Its a film that does it all. Stanley Kubrick described it as "Possibly the greatest movie ever made". It is a juncture between classic and modern cinema. Not a dry, cinematic relic that you feel obliged to bow before, but a not-blooded living god that you embrace. The modernism, meanwhile is felt not only in its squib-heavy bloodletting, but also the way it handles the gangster flick itself. <br>That theme, of course, being brilliantly embodied by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone : The W W II hero, determined to stay distant from his Dad's dodgy business but who ultimately becomes enwrapped in its soul-tainting shadows. Brando may get the most attention as the wheezing Don, but there's no denying this is really Pacino's show. </p><br>
