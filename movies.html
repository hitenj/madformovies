	<h1>100 GREATEST MOVIES</h1>

	<p class="intro">History of Cinema is always been huge. More than half-million movies have been made till date in the whole world out of which only a few of them had made a long-lasting impact in the hearts of the audience. There are two types of people in this world : One who watch movies alond with other stuffs and the other who just watch movies and whole heartedly love them. They are the ones who we call 'MAD FOR MOVIES'. Also remember movies has no single language, rather they have performances which get sync with every language of this world. Every year thousands of movies are released but only very few are tagged as 'MasterPiece' and some of them print their name in the history.</p>
			<br><br>
	<img src="media/index.jpg" class="index-img"><br><br>

	<p class="intro">This list I have made is according to my opinions plus some famous critics poll that have took place in the past. It was a difficult task to put only 100 of them but these are the best among them. After a lot of thinking that which film should be given the first spot as everytime argument arises whether Shawshank Redemption is the best or The Godfather. Critics have also hailed The Citizen Kane. But I have made the list keeping in mind the respect for all genres, age group of audiences and many other important factors.</p>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win."- Joey La Motta</p>
			<p><strong>Scorses</strong> and <strong>De Niro</strong> have made movies better than their boxing biopic, but its hard to argue that any of those movies feature a more jaw dropping performance than <strong>De Niro's</strong> here. It also features some of cinema's best shot fights. <strong>Scorsese</strong> used chocolate as blood in boxing scenes because it showed better in B/W.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about. A deer's gotta be taken with one shot."- Michael</p>
			<p>This movie is both breathtakingly moving and at times a disapponting self indulgent. When <strong>John Cazale</strong> got sick during filming, the studio wanted to recast, but streep threatened to walk off the picture if it did.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Cast : </strong>Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon</p>
			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"Well, nobody's perfect!"- Osgood</p>
			<p>A movie that features what is arguably <strong>Marilyn Monroe's</strong> best performance, not to mention one of her own finest features. This cross-dressing caper also has what must be the greatest last line in history : <em>"Well, nobody's perfect!"</em></p><br>

			<p>There's an earthy, primal feel to his fairy-world here, alien and threatening rather than gasp-inducing and <em>'magical'</em>. Only Spanish-Language Movie here.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"Yo, Adrian! Its me Rocky."- Rocky</p>
			<p><strong>Stallone</strong> wrote the script's first draft in just three days, then refused to sell it unless he was cast in the lead role. The story proves that winning isn't the most important thing(you gotta go the distance).</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"Love is the only one thing that transcend time and space"- Brand</p>
			<p>From the effects of gravity to emotional implication of time dilation, it mixes science and sentiment to great effect. And it has a sarcastic robot, too.</p><br>

			<p>It perfectly cast : <strong>DiCaprio</strong> and <strong>Damon</strong> as the facing-off moles, <strong>Nicholson</strong> as the Whitey Bulger-esque Mob boss and ,(arguably best), <strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong> as America's swearist cop. <strong>Scorsese</strong> cookes up a juicy and bloody steak of a movie.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"I can't remember to forget you."- Leonard</p>
			<p><strong>Nolan</strong> made the world sit up and pay attention to him by crafting a revenge fuelled crime thriller. It's precision engineered : every scene lasts as long as the span of damaged protagonist Leonard Shelby's short-term memory, as well as running in reverse order and it works.</p><br>

			<p>It's all about the value of looking at things differently, and a reminder that nothing is more important than great dialogue. This film finds all its drama inside a jury deliberation room packed with fantastic character actors. The last surviving jurist, Jack Klugman, died in 2012</p><br>

			<p>Photographer LB Jeffries (<strong>James Stewart</strong>) is on sick leave, with a broken leg. He's bored to tears, so he starts spying on his neighbours. Then he witnesses a murder. OR DOES HE? <strong>HITCHCOCK</strong> really know how to take a distance corker of a premise and turned it into peerless thriller. He is surely a Master of Suspense.</p><br>

			<p>For a western world raised on disney movies, it was a bracing change of pace. Taking in bathovers, spirits of Shinto Folklore, and morality without clear-cut distinction of good and evil. It is ofcourse utterly beautiful, too-boundlessly imaginative, and steeped in gorgeous colour,and stunningly scored by Joe Hisaishi. Young hero, Chihiro, forced to fend for herself when her parents turned into pigs. Earn with boy-dragon-spirit Haku, her freedom from spirit-world.</p><br>

			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"No i am your father"- Darth Wader</p>
			<p>The strongest of the saga not because enemies or the twist but it deepens the core relationships(Han and leia's)she loves him,he knows and it still hurts. The hero loses a hand but gains a father somewhat a shakespearean tragedy. It displays the same soaring imagination that made <em>Star Wars</em>   a filmmaking classic; most other space movies seem clunky and earthbound in comparison.</p><br>

			<h2>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION</h2>
			<p>(1994)<br><br><em>Drama/Crime</em><i class="fa fa-imdb"></i>  9.3 90%  </p>
			<p><strong>Director : </strong>Frank Darabont</p>
			<p><strong>Cast : </strong>Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton</p>
			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"Remember Red,Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things,and no good thing ever dies."- </p>
			<p>It was a box-office flop on release the warm leathery embrace of Morgan freeman's narration... few directorial debuts are so deftly constructed;frank has top it. This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly kinded view of human nature. <strong>Freeman</strong>, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his carrer, both narrates this tale and anchors it with authoritative playing.</p><br>

			<h2>THE GODFATHER</h2>
			<p>(1972)<br><br><em>Crime/Drama</em><i class="fa fa-imdb"></i>  9.2 98%  </p>
			<p><strong>Director : </strong>Francis Ford Coppola</p>
			<p><strong>Cast : </strong>Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire</p>
			<p><strong>Famous Quote : </strong>"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse "- Don Corleone</p>
			<p>It came as Mario Puzo's novel. Its a film that does it all. Stanley Kubrick described it as "Possibly the greatest movie ever made". It is a juncture between classic and modern cinema. Not a dry, cinematic relic that you feel obliged to bow before, but a not-blooded living god that you embrace. The modernism, meanwhile is felt not only in its squib-heavy bloodletting, but also the way it handles the gangster flick itself. <br>That theme, of course, being brilliantly embodied by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone : The W W II hero, determined to stay distant from his Dad's dodgy business but who ultimately becomes enwrapped in its soul-tainting shadows. Brando may get the most attention as the wheezing Don, but there's no denying this is really Pacino's show. </p><br>
